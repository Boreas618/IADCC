**Abstract** With the progression of artificial intelligence, there has been substantial advancement in autonomous driving technology. However, even the most advanced systems may confront failures in certain corner cases, necessitating enhanced analytical approaches. Traditional approaches focused on the numerical analysis of isolated sensor data, are often insufficient for deriving meaningful insights in such situations. To address this inadequacy, we propose a visual analytics approach, crafted to aid domain experts in performing analyses and extracting system improvements from cases with unexpected behaviors. This approach intricately integrates extensive driving scenarios and low-level module behaviors into the autonomous driving decision-making process, utilizing rich visualizations and an interface for interactive exploration and systematic synthesis of findings. Uniquely, our system opens the "black box" of modules in the decision-making pipeline during corner cases, taking into account both the overall decision-making pipeline and the fine-grained behaviors of the modules in the pipeline, setting our approach apart from previous works. To validate our system’s effectiveness, we perform two case studies, inviting domain experts for evaluation, and the results confirm our system’s efficacy in allowing experts to obtain crucial insights into autonomous driving systems.
